# Week 2
# The Linux Operating System

# Introduction to Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s. It aimed to improve the UNIX operating system and make it accessible to everyone. Torvalds introduced the Linux kernel, which was revolutionary. Around the same time, Richard Stallman worked on GNU, another UNIX-based operating system. Torvalds and Stallman's innovations combined to create what is now known as Linux. Linux is unique because it is open source, allowing anyone to access and modify the source code. It is licensed under the GNU Public License, enabling free use and modification. Linux has a strong community of developers and offers various distributions tailored to different needs, including security programs. As a security analyst, Linux is used for tasks such as log examination, access management, and specific distributions for forensic analysis and penetration testing.

Linux Architecture

Linux consists of several key components: the user, applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), the kernel, and the hardware. The user is the person interacting with the computer, initiating tasks or commands. Linux supports multiple users simultaneously. Applications are programs that perform specific tasks, distributed through package managers. The shell is a command line interpreter, serving as the interface for communication with the system. The FHS organizes data, acting as a filing cabinet for the system. The kernel manages processes and memory, communicating with hardware and ensuring efficient resource allocation. Finally, hardware comprises the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, mouse, and keyboard.

# Linux Distributions

Linux is a highly customizable operating system with different versions known as distributions or distros. Each distribution is like a different type of vehicle built upon the Linux kernel, similar to how various vehicles are built using different engines. Just as vehicles serve different purposes, different Linux distributions are used for different reasons and offer unique features. Users can choose distributions based on their needs and preferences, similar to selecting a vehicle for specific requirements. Linux distributions come with preinstalled programs, user interfaces, and other components that can be customized. The advantage of Linux is its open-source nature, allowing anyone to contribute to the source code and create new distributions. Some distributions are derived from others, with a few considered parent distributions, such as Red Hat® and Debian.

KALI LINUX™ is a widely used Linux distribution in the field of security, specifically designed for penetration testing and digital forensics. It is an open-source distro derived from Debian and developed by Offensive Security. KALI LINUX™ comes with a variety of pre-installed tools for conducting penetration tests, identifying vulnerabilities, and testing weaknesses in web applications. It is recommended to use KALI LINUX™ on a virtual machine to prevent any potential damage to the host system and provide the ability to revert to a previous state. Additionally, KALI LINUX™ offers numerous tools for digital forensics, including packet analyzers like tcpdump, network traffic analysis with Wireshark, and hard drive/smartphone analysis using Autopsy.

# The Shell

The shell is a crucial component of the Linux architecture that plays a significant role for security analysts. It serves as a command-line interpreter, enabling communication between the user and the operating system. Acting as a command-line interface, the shell allows users to enter instructions or commands to instruct the computer. These commands are then executed by the kernel. The shell acts as a language interpreter, bridging the gap between humans and the computer system, as users cannot directly communicate in computer language. It enables users to perform various tasks, such as mathematical operations, testing, and running applications. Importantly, the shell allows for the combination and automation of these tasks, enabling complex operations to be performed.

Communicating with the shell in Linux is akin to conversing with a friend. Just like in a conversation, one person asks a question and the other responds. Similarly, when interacting with the shell, commands can receive input, produce output, or generate error messages. Standard input refers to the information entered via the command line, resembling a question to your friend. The shell interprets the input and requests resources from the kernel to execute the task. Standard output represents the response from the OS through the shell, similar to your friend's answer. It is the output you receive. Standard error contains error messages when the system cannot respond to a command, either due to misspellings or insufficient permissions.
