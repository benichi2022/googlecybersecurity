# Week 2 

NIST CSF
Security Frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. orgs use them as the starting point to build their security mechanism.

Security controls : safeguards used to reduce specific risks.

Encryption - converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. (confidentiality)
Authentication - process of verifying who someone or something is. (MFA - biometrics)
 - vishing
Authorization - concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.
	- deep web

Security posture = cybersecurity frameworks + cybersecurity controls

CIA Triad - core security model
 a model that helps inform how orgs consider risk when setting up systems and security     
 policies

NIST Framework
CSF - a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
 Identify - protect - detect - respond - recover

1) Identify 
	- mngment of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an org's people and assets
2) Protect
	- to protect an org through imple of policies, proc, training and tools
3) Detect 
	- identifying potential sec incidents and improving monitoring capabilities
4) Respond
	- proper procedures used to contain, neutralize and analyze sec incidents 
5) Recover
	- process of returning affected systems back to normal ops

OWASP Security principles
open web application source project

- minimize attack surface area - (all potential vulnerabilities)
- principle of least privilege - least amt of access required to perform everyday task
- defense in depth (multiple security controls)
- separation of duties - critical actions should rely on multiple people.
- keep security simple - avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions.
- fix security issues correctly- identify root cause, contain impact and so on
- default to secure place
- fail securely
- avoid security through obsecurity


# Plan Security Audit
a review of an org's security controls, policies and procedures against set of expectations.

Internal and External
Internal - level of entry level of analysts
- identify org risk
- assess controls
- correct compliance issues

elements of internal audits
- establishing the scope and goals - specific criteria - people, asset, policies, procedure
- conducting a risk assessment - outline of security objectives
- completing a controls assessment
	administrative control
	technical control
	physical control
- assessing compliance - laws organizations must follow.
- communicating results
