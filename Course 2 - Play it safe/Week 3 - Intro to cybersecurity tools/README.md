Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools

Previously, we saw security frameworks, controls and design principles. In this week, we will certain cybersecurity tools used by security analysts to keep organizations safe.


Log - is a record of events that occur within an organizations's systems and networks.
Common logs sources include: 

- Firewall Logs - is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming or outgoing traffic from and to the internet.

- Network Logs - is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network and connections between devices and services on the network.

- Server Logs - is a record of events related to services such as websites, emails or file shares including actions such as login, password and username requests.

A security information and event management, or SIEM, tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.

It provides:

* Real-time visibility
* event monitoring and analysis and automated alerts.

# SIEM Dashboards:
Provide friendly interface to analyse data using graphs and charts. They also provide stakeholders metrics such response time, availability and failure rate to assess the performance of a software application.

The future of SIEM Tools:
Currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for analysis of security events.
SIEM tools can be cloud-hosted and cloud-native, in the former they are operated by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools. Cloud-native SIEM tools are fully maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet. They are designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilites, such as availability, flexibility and scalability. Additionally, as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology continues to progress, SIEM capabilities will be enhanced to better identify threat-related terminology, dashboard visualization, and data storage functionality.

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of SIEM tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, can’t be automated with a SOAR.

Explore common SIEM Tools:

different types of SIEM tools:

* Self-hosted SIEM tools require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity.

* cloud-hosted SIEM tools are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet

* or a hybrid SIEM solution.

Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, and Chronicle are common SIEM tools that many organizations use to help protect their data and systems.

Splunk is a data analysis platform and splunk enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze and search an organization's log data to provide security info and alerts in real-time.

Splunk cloud - is a cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search and monitor log data.

Chronicle - a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze and search data.

More on cybersecurity tools:
They can be open-source, proprietary with limited features for trial.

Examples:
Linux - is an operating system.
suricata - is an intrusion detection system. Both open-source project, available to the public for free.
