Lines of code are used to communicate with a computer, similar to a sentence, telling it how to perform a task. Programming is used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Python is considered to be a general-purpose language. This means that it can create a variety of different programs, and it isn't a specialized in any particular problem in fields such as web development and artificial intelligence. Python is typically used to build websites and perform data analysis. In security, the main reason we use Python is to automate our tasks. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to perform common and repetitive tasks.
In addition to automating individual tasks, Python can combine separate tasks into one workstream. So why exactly might a security professional choose Python for these tasks? There are several advantages Python has as a programming language. For one, Python is user-friendly because it resembles human language, it requires less code, and it's easy to read. Python programmers also have the benefit of following standard guidelines to ensure consistency with the design and readability of code. Another great reason for learning Python is that there's a large amount of online support. Python also has an extensive collection of built-in code that we can import and use to perform many different tasks.

 When we work in Python, we refer to what we write as a "script" or a "program." In Python, it's good practice to start with a comment. A comment is a note programmers make about the intention behind their code.

Simple python script used for printing message:

we want to output the string "Hello Python!" We must place string data in quotation marks. These quotation marks are just one example of syntax that you will encounter in Python. Syntax refers to the rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language. 

# Core Python Components
Data types in python
A data type is a category for a particular type of data item. String data is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. These characters could be letters, symbols, spaces, and even numbers.
Strings must be placed within qoutes. Otherwise, python will return an error.

Python also supports numeric data types as well. When working with numeric data, we don't put quotation marks around the data. Numeric data includes floats and integers. Float data is data consisting of a number with a decimal point. This includes fractions like 2.1 or 10.5. It also includes whole numbers with a decimal point like 2.0 or 10.0.
Integer data is data consisting of a number that does not include a decimal point. Numbers such as 0, -9, and 5,000 are valid integers. The third data type in Python is called a Boolean. Boolean data is data that can only be one of two values: either "True" or "False." Booleans are useful for logic in our programs. For example, let's compare numbers and determine the Boolean values of these comparisons.

List data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form. We'll create and print a list that prints all the usernames of the three individuals that have access to a confidential file.

A variable is a container that stores data. To create a variable, you need a name for it. Then, you add an equals sign and then an object to store in it. Creating a variable is often called assignment. The best practice for naming variables is to make the names relevant to what they're being used for. 

String Data Type:

"Calling" the variable

Data type of a variable is the same as the data type of the data it stores.

and type function to check the data type.

After we define a variable, we can always change the object inside of it. This is called reassignment. Reassigning a variable is very similar to assigning it in the first place. Let's try this out and reassign a variable.
