# Introduction to Asset Security

The increasing dependence on technology is evident in our daily lives, with personal devices connecting us globally and businesses embracing it for efficiency. However, this reliance also leads to vast amounts of data and challenges in data security. This creates a demand for diverse professionals to tackle cyber threats. The importance of security and the components of a security plan, including asset management and NIST Cybersecurity Framework, are explored in the video.
The video emphasizes the importance of practice and planning in the security profession. Just like in other activities, practice is crucial for improvement. Businesses, like individuals, plan ahead by analyzing risks and creating security plans. Security teams focus on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, which are the components of the CIA triad. Security plans are based on analyzing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, with prioritization being key due to the vast number of assets. Threats can negatively impact assets, and vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited. The video suggests that security teams need to consider a wide range of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to effectively plan for the future.
The video highlights the importance of asset management in security. Just as individuals experience stress when they can't find important items, organizations face similar challenges. Asset management involves tracking and protecting valuable items for an organization. Asset inventories serve as a catalog of assets that need protection, allowing for resource allocation and quick detection of missing items. Asset classification ranks assets based on their sensitivity and importance to the organization. Common classification schemes include public, internal-only, confidential, and restricted. Each classification determines the level of access and protection required. Continuous asset management helps identify potential security risks and ensures the organization keeps track of its valuable assets.

# Digital and Physical Assets

The video discusses the significance of data and its protection in the digital age. Data, in the form of information processed or stored by computers, is constantly being exchanged between connected devices. Security teams focus on safeguarding data in three states: in use, in transit, and at rest. Data in use refers to actively accessed information, while data in transit pertains to data being transmitted between points. Data at rest is data stored on physical devices when not in use. Effective information security practices are essential to prevent unauthorized access to data, as weak security can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage. As technology evolves, the concept of data at rest is also changing, with data now commonly stored in the cloud rather than solely on physical devices. Security analysts must remain vigilant and adapt to new vulnerabilities in an increasingly connected world. Protecting data requires understanding its location and activities, enabling security teams to assess risks and develop appropriate asset management plans.


# Risk and Asset Security


Security is a collective effort involving people, processes, and technology. It goes beyond the responsibility of a single person or an IT department and instead encompasses the entire organizational culture. Security plans are crucial in preparing for and addressing risks that may impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of assets. These plans should focus on people, considering their diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Risks are categorized based on factors such as information damage, disclosure, loss, physical damage, malfunctions, attacks, and human error. To communicate security plans effectively, three key elements are utilized: policies, standards, and procedures.

Policies establish rules that mitigate risk and protect information, addressing what needs to be protected and why. They provide strategic guidance, outlining the scope, objectives, and limitations of the security plan. Standards serve as references, informing the implementation of policies. They create benchmarks for secure practices and help organizations improve their security measures. Procedures consist of step-by-step instructions for performing specific security tasks. They ensure accountability, consistency, and efficiency across the organization.

While policies, standards, and procedures may vary across organizations, understanding their structure is essential for effective security planning. By fostering a shared understanding of security principles and involving everyone in the process, organizations can build a robust security culture and make security a team effort.


Compliance is an essential aspect of securing assets, involving adherence to internal standards and external regulations. Companies prioritize security compliance to maintain trust, reputation, safety, and data integrity. Failure to comply with regulations can result in severe financial and reputational consequences, particularly in highly regulated industries like healthcare, energy, and finance. Regulations are rules established by governments or authorities to govern processes and protect people and their information.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, provides a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. The framework comprises three main components: the core, tiers, and profiles.

The core represents the functions or duties of a security plan and includes five categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. It serves as a security checklist.

Tiers are used to measure performance across the core functions, ranging from Level-1 (passive) to Level-4 (adaptive). Tiers provide insights into the effectiveness of security plans and highlight areas for improvement.

Profiles offer a snapshot of the current state of a security plan, enabling comparisons over time and identifying changes and improvements.

Compliance with security regulations and frameworks goes beyond avoiding penalties and attacks. It reflects a commitment to safeguarding people and their information. Understanding the core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, such as identification and protection, lays the foundation for effective security practices and sets the path for further exploration.
