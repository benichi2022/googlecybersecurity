# Safeguard Information

In today's world, information is scattered across various platforms, putting organizations under immense pressure to establish robust security controls to safeguard everyone's data from theft or exposure. Security controls encompass a wide range of measures designed to mitigate specific security risks, and they can be categorized into three types: technical, operational, and managerial.

Technical controls involve the use of technologies like encryption and authentication systems to protect assets. Operational controls focus on day-to-day security maintenance, such as awareness training and incident response. Managerial controls revolve around risk reduction and include policies, standards, and procedures.

Security policies serve as guidelines for organizations, outlining the necessary controls to achieve their security goals. Information privacy plays a crucial role in these decisions, as it concerns protecting data from unauthorized access and distribution. Individuals and organizations should have the right to determine when, how, and to what extent their private information is shared.

To illustrate the importance of security controls in maintaining information privacy, consider booking a flight through a travel app. While you expect the airline company to access your personal information for reservation purposes, it's unnecessary for everyone within the company to have access to your credit card details. The principle of least privilege dictates that security controls should limit access based on the user and situation, ensuring privacy.

Furthermore, security controls should align with the principle of least privilege by differentiating between data owners and data custodians. Data owners have the authority to decide who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information, while data custodians are responsible for securely handling and storing the data, including organizations and their systems.

Implementing security controls also involves considering proper classification and handling of data, recognizing it as a valuable asset. Just like any other asset, information privacy necessitates appropriate treatment and protection.
